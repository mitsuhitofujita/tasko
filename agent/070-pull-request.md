## Pull Request
Please write the Pull Request title and description in Japanese.
For the title, concisely state what this Pull Request does.
In the Pull Request description, explain why the chosen approach was adopted.
Use the `gh` command to create Pull Requests. Make sure you are already logged in to GitHub; verify with `gh auth status`.
Do not use `\n` to insert newlines because `\n` will not render as a line break on GitHub â€” use an EOF-style heredoc instead when creating the PR body from the command line.
