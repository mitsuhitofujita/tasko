# Task Management Web Application

## Key Requirements

- Allow a user to manage their own tasks as a list
- Create, edit, and delete tasks (top-level)
- Mark tasks complete and undo completion
- Each task can have a title, description, URL, and due date
- Reorder tasks via drag-and-drop
- Add, edit, and delete subtasks for a task (subtasks may also have description, URL, and due date)
- Reorder subtasks within their parent task
- Subtasks can be marked complete and undone
- Support setting an active subtask
- Allow copying the task list to the clipboard as Markdown

> Note: Prioritize a subtask-centric UX. The UI is expected to support inline editing, drag interactions, and calendar date selection.

## Purpose of the application
