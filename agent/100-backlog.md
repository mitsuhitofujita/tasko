# Backlog - Future Enhancements

This document contains features and improvements that were identified during development but are not implemented in the current version. These items can be addressed in future iterations.

## Performance and Cost Optimizations

### Batch Processing for Firestore Updates
**Priority**: Medium  
**Description**: Implement batched writes for multi-document updates to reduce Firestore costs and improve consistency.

**Current State**: 
- Drag-and-drop operations update only the dragged task's order value
- Each task update is a separate Firestore write operation

**Future Enhancement**:
- Implement Firestore batched writes (up to 500 writes per batch)
- Group multiple order updates into single batch operations
- Consider debouncing frequent updates during fast dragging
- Implement server-side transactions for critical ordering consistency

**Technical Notes**:
- Use Firestore's `batch()` API for multiple document updates
- Consider implementing on server-side for better error handling
- May require UI loading states during batch operations

## Accessibility Improvements

### ARIA Attributes for Interactive Elements
**Priority**: Medium  
**Description**: Add proper ARIA attributes for drag handles and action buttons to improve screen reader accessibility.

**Current State**:
- Drag handles and action buttons lack ARIA labels
- Interactive elements may not be properly announced to screen readers

**Future Enhancement**:
- Add `aria-label` attributes to drag handles (e.g., "Drag to reorder task")
- Add `aria-label` attributes to action buttons (e.g., "Complete task", "Delete task")
- Implement `aria-describedby` for additional context
- Add `role` attributes where semantic HTML is insufficient
- Consider `aria-live` regions for dynamic updates

**Technical Notes**:
- Follow WAI-ARIA guidelines for drag-and-drop interfaces
- Test with screen readers (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver)
- Consider keyboard-only navigation patterns

## Implementation Guidelines

When implementing these backlog items:

1. **Batch Processing**: Start with server-side implementation for better error handling
2. **ARIA Attributes**: Implement incrementally, testing with actual screen readers
3. **Testing**: Include accessibility testing in the development process
4. **Performance**: Monitor Firestore costs before and after batch implementation

## Notes

These items were identified during the initial implementation of the task management dashboard but were deferred to maintain focus on core functionality and meet project timeline requirements.
